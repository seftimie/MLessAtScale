# MLessAtScale
Google Cloud Easy as Pie Serverless Hackathon


**MLess as Scale**: Create, train and deploy a ML model in a serverless way for predictions in real time, at scale, using BigQuery ML, Cloud Storage, Cloud Build and Cloud Run. Our solution is full serverless.  


You can deploy and test **MLess as Scale** in two ways: 
- with a pipeline via Google Cloud Shell: see [code](https://github.com/seftimie/MLessAtScale/tree/main/pipeline) or [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cTKhjzsL-o)
- with a Next.js web app in Cloud Run see [code](https://github.com/seftimie/MLessAtScale/tree/main/app) or [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFdn7fN84mU)
